                    <p>Autonomous robots that interact interestingly with their environments, especially using cameras, are my favorite types of robots to build. I am entering my 3rd season FIRST Tech Challenge competitive robotics, where my team and I design, build, program, drive, and present our robots. Our team primarily uses off-the-shelf steel materials; 3D printed parts out of various material types; laser cut acrylic and PETG; plasma cut or waterjet aluminum; and more. I lead our design subteam, and help build and program our robot as well. I also spend a lot of my free time at home with robotics using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, primarily building with 3D printed and laser cut parts, as well as manually machined parts. I use OnShape to design most components, and program robots with Java, C, and Python.</p>

                    <h5><a href="programming.html">Programming</a></h5>
                    <p>Writing code is a great way to explore mathematical experiments, interesting algorithms, and fun tools. A lot of my programming projects were done on Replit, Jupyter Notebooks, and occaisonally Unity. I like creating solutions to games and solving geometric puzzles using code, as well as creating helpful tools for various situations. I commonly use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for websites, Python and Java for Jupyter Notebooks and individual files, C for Arduino, and C# for Unity. My more interesting projects(in my opinion) make use of computer vision, AI, and 3D geometry.</p>

                    <p>I have created several informal and experimental 'games' in Unity and Replit that I mostly used to practice my game development and have fun. None are even close to professional or fully complete, but they still make use of interesting mechanics, fun visuals, and, to some degree, challenging gameplay. I also have made animations and simulations in Blender, which are also just for practice and fun; these are mostly random and strange. I also use Blender to make CAD renders and rendered background images.</p>
